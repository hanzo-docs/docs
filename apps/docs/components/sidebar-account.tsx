 * Who you are, at the foot of the sidebar.

 * These controls used to sit in the top bar, competing for a fixed 56px row
 * with the logo, six section links and the search trigger — and "Get API Key"
 * is the widest label on the page, so it was the thing that broke first: at
 * 768-805px it reflowed to three lines and spilled above and below the bar.
 *
 * The foot of the sidebar has the opposite properties. It is a column, so a
 * label that grows takes a row rather than overflowing a bar; it is stable
 * across pages; and it is where a reader already looks for "who am I" because
 * that is where every console puts it.

/**
 * The top bar's half of the same account, and ONLY for someone who has one.
 *
 * Getting a key is asked once, at the foot of the rail, under Sign in — the free
 * step first, the commitment last. This used to ask a second time from the top
 * bar whenever the rail was a drawer, so a phone showed the pill above the page
 * title AND the full phrase inside the drawer: two buttons, two labels ("API
 * key" and "Get an API key"), one action. A reader cannot tell whether those are
 * the same door, and the answer to "where do I get a key" stopped being a place.
 *
 * The signed-IN avatar stays, because it is not the same question. It says who
 * you are and opens the console; it is the only account affordance a collapsed
 * rail has, and it duplicates nothing.
 *
 * The cost is real and taken deliberately: on a phone the CTA now lives one tap
 * inside the drawer. That is the price of the answer being one place, and the
 * rail is the place, because that is where it is on every desktop.
